            <p>FutureSkills portal is designed as a resource for the IT-ITeS industry to enable discovery, continuous
                learning and deep skilling in 10 emerging technologies (Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Big Data
                Analytics, Cloud Computing, Cyber Security, Internet of Things, Mobile Tech, Robotic Process Automation,
                Virtual Reality & 3D Printing). The portal has been designed as a marketplace and content library, where
                the best global providers of content and learning come together to offer learners information on the
                latest jobs, the skills needed for those jobs, learning content, assessments and certifications. The
                platform is fueled by a curation engine that has the ability to trawl the massive amount of high quality
                learning content available on the web and funnel it in an easy to consume format that’s meaningful and
                effective for the learners. </p>

                            through their areas of interest. Learners can either choose to ‘follow’ a particular
                            technology, job role or skill and get a wide variety of bite sized learning being delivered
                            to their learning feed on their computer or smartphone or can define their areas of interest
                            and have the AI based curation engine select what is best suited for their interests and
                            learning styles. </p>

                            learner on a journey that can be undertaken at any time. Learners get 5 pieces of curated
                            content every day, in addition to material from the courses they may have signed up for.
                            Continuous learning prepares for readiness, augments an existing training program and
                            reinforces learning after the learning event is over. Vlabs and assessments aid in the
                            application.</p>
